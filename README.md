# Monte Carlo Simulation of Seasonal Spatial Dynamics

This repository contains a Monte Carlo–based spatial simulation developed as part of academic coursework.
The project investigates how **seasonal relocation of food sources** and **cyclical habitat variation**
affect a simulated ecological environment over time.

## Overview
- Models **weekly seasonal dynamics** across a one-year cycle (53 iterations)
- Examines **time-dependent, circular relocation of food sources** around a central lake
- Incorporates **seasonal expansion and contraction of the lake** as a changing habitat constraint
- Provides visual monitoring of spatial and seasonal dynamics

## Contribution Scope
The work presented here focuses specifically on:
- Seasonal **food location** dynamics (spatial movement, not quantity)
- Time-dependent spatial structure of food sources
- Seasonal habitat variation through lake size changes
- Visualization and monitoring of spatial dynamics

## Methods & Tools
- Monte Carlo simulation
- R
- knitr, lattice, plotrix, vcd

## Repository Contents
- `MonteCarlo_simulation.Rmd` — reproducible simulation and analysis
- `MonteCarlo_simulation.pdf` — rendered report with results and visualizations
